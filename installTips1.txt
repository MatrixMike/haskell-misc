try :
./BinariesVersionCheck.sh
maybe need this : stack config set system-ghc --global true
cabal install juicypixels

I used geany 1.31 to compile : ghc --make "%f"  -v

would like to change source to consistently spell JuicyPixels in the same way the stack.yaml file has it such that :
grep uicy -ir *  
works nicely.
An aim of this lovely project is to show how to create a package or project (need correct word here) that just builds happily after downloading from github.
