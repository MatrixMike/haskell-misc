# haskell-misc
Credit to Alan for creating these examples.

here are some great code snippet examples that I have reworked slightly 
using hindent and hlint in order to see 'standard' Haskell.
The files modified have received attention and have been slightly mod'd 
such that they are obvious by date. I use geany (under Linux) for 
compilation often and then try to process them in the cabal repl. Often 
there are missing dependencies and I need to learn how to fix this issue...
